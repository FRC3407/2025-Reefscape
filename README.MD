# 2025 Reefscape

## Description

The FRC 2025 competition code for 3407 Wildcards. This robot uses a wheel and track based intake system, a top and bottom roller shooter, and a two climber-in-a-box based climber. The vision system uses eyes and is designed to detect April Tags in order to determine field positioning used for aim assist.
